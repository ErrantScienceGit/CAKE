Ingredients

for CAKE
125g  Butter (at room temperature)
125g  caster sugar
2     eggs (not straight from fridge)
1/2 tsp Vanilla extract (or scrape the seeds from 1/2 vanilla pod - if you're posh!)
125g  plain flour
3/4 tspn  baking powder
Some  Milk
3 tbspn  drinking chocolate (or 50g ish? melted chocolate - not cooking chocolate)
1/2 cup Chocolate chips (any colour, but White would LOOK awesome!)

for ICING
140g  icing sugar, sifted (and don't make the mistake of using ready mixed Royal icing sugar - it won't make buttercream...)
70g unsalted Butter (at room temp.)
splash of milk (not straight from fridge)
slightly less than 1/4 tsp  vanilla

2x 15cm/6" tins or 1x 20cm tin
pre-heat oven to 180 C (fan assisted) for other types of oven - JFGI...


Steps

1 - Cream the butter and sugar into a delicious and squidgy mess - using a wooden spoon or mixer.
2 - Crack in the eggs and beat together (add in melted chocolate at this stage)
3 - Sieve flour and baking powder together. Add to wet ingredients in thirds and fold in after each addition
4 - Sieve drinking chocolate into wet mix and fold all together
5 - Add a little milk until it has a custard-like consistency
6 - GENTLY stir in choc chips until distributed throughout (but don't worry yourself about evenly disbursed!)
7 - Grease a cake tin and line with thing to stop the cake sticking (baking parchment)
8 - Pour cake batter into tin/s
9 - Cook at 180 degrees C for about 20mins
10 - Place on a rack to cool - for approx 1 hour before icing (otherwise = melty, slidey mess...)
11 - Icing, mandatory!! Butter icing please... or whipped cream with strawberries on top...
12 - Eat :)

(can be made by hand with wooden spoon but easier with electric hand or stand mixer)

2 - put butter into large bowl or the mixer
3 - at a low speed, start to cream the soft butter, then add a couple of spoons of sugar REMAINING AT A LOW SPEED.
4 - in small amounts, add the remaining sugar, while mixing until it is all smoothly blended together
5 - add a splash of milk, and mix in on a low speed until smooth
