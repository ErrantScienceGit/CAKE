3 - Fold in melted chocolate and milk,
4 - Sieve flour and baking powder together. Add to wet ingredients in thirds and fold in after each addition
5 - Sieve drinking chocolate into wet mix and fold all together
6 - Add a little milk until it has a custard-like consistency
7 - GENTLY stir in choc chips until distributed throughout (but don't worry yourself about evenly disbursed!)
8 - Grease a cake tin and line with thing to stop the cake sticking (baking parchment), or grease with melted butter and then sprinkle flour around it to stop sticking
